# Golden Ticket: Explore Lottery Numbers with Data Analysis

**Golden Ticket is an open-source project** that provides a unique, data-driven approach to exploring lottery number combinations. It's designed as a game where you try to find the "Golden Ticket" – the combination that most closely matches the actual winning numbers after each draw.

**Important:** This app is for entertainment and analytical purposes *only*. There is no real-money gambling, no way to buy tickets, and no real-world prizes. Think of it like a "fortune cookie" for lottery numbers – offering potentially insightful combinations, but with *no guarantees* of winning.

## Key Features

*   **Combination Retrieval:** Get lottery number combinations from our server. These combinations are pre-generated based on our analysis of historical lottery data from WCLC (Western Canada Lottery Corporation).
*   **User-Defined Combination IDs (Coming Soon!):** Retrieve combinations using your own interactive method on your devices.
*   **Check Results & Score:** *After* each draw, see how your *retrieved* combinations performed. Earn points based on how many numbers you match (for in-app scoring *only*).
*   **Transparency:** Before each draw, we publish an encrypted archive of our current combination set. The password is released after the draw, allowing for independent verification.
*   **Leaderboards (Coming Soon!):** Compare your in-app scores with other users.
*   **Track Your Progress (Coming Soon!):** Monitor your combinations and scores.
*   **Community Forum (Coming Soon!):** Share strategies and connect with others. Note: Any group play or pooling of combinations happens *outside* of this app.
*   **Free Account (Always Available):** Access a limited number of combinations per draw, completely free.

## Our Approach (Early Stage Research)

We are exploring the possibility of identifying subtle statistical patterns in historical lottery data. We are *not* claiming to predict winning numbers or to guarantee any improvement in odds. The system is experimental and under continuous development. Our current data source is WCLC records, and we are working to ensure its accuracy and completeness. There are *absolutely no guarantees* of matching any numbers in real lottery draws.
